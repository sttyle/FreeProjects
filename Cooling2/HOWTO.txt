Abstract
========
        This document describes how to use Cooling 2 (beta) add-on for World
        of Warcraft. It tries to be quick but also thorough guide.



What Cooling 2 is and how it works in general?
==============================================
        Cooling 2 (beta) is add-on to show cooldowns in 15 configurable icons.
        User has lot of freedom to configure how and what cooldowns are shown.
        As a result beta version of this add-on is NOT FOR NOVICE USERS. User
        must have time and patience to at least read this doc.
        
        Everytime when cooldowns chance this addon will go through all
        abilities (=spells, items...) and compare if they match with rulesets
        and then setup icons and scrolling combat text to show cooldowns.
        
        

What is there by default?
=========================
        If you start Cooling 2 at the 1st time, you will be given 5 icon
        groups: Group 1 is general ability cooldowns, Group 2 is item cooldowns
        and there is 3 class dependant icons for special cooldowns and
        counterspell detection. Also ability and item cooldowns trigger
        Flowing/Scrolling combat text notification.
        
        Icons are placed in the middle of your screen, but depending on your
        other UI settings and scale you might need to move them to better
        positions.
        


General Slash commands
======================

    /cooling (or /cooldown or /cool)
    
        This is just handle command. It should react if cooling is installed
        and does nothing except showing small reminder of available /slash
        commands
        
        
    /cooling setup
    
        This will cause cooling 2 to enter ICON SETUP MODE. Calling it again it
        will exit icon setup mode and return normal operation mode. In this
        mode user can move icons and modify icon groups. Moving icons are
        obvious: Drag icons by keeping left mouse button pressed. If you drag
        master icon of the group then all sequent icon that are in the same
        group will move along.
        
        By clicking right mouse button you can toggle if icon will be master of
        its icon group: Clicking master icon will make icon group to merge with
        lower icon group. And clicking non-master icon will make it master icon
        and create new icon group.
        
        Icons are numbered with 2 numbers in setup mode (like 9:2). First
        number indicates the number of icon and latter indicates the icon group
        it is part of. Icon number will be used f.e in scale and alpha command and
        icon group number is used in rule sets.
        
        
    /cooling refresh [on/off]

        Without parameters this will clear all notification lists and icons,
        and go through all abilities to check what is on cooldown. This is
        recommended command if you know that icons are showing wrong or old
        cooldowns. Use this after Cold Snap.
        
        If given with parameter then it toggle automatic refresh on/off. If set
        "on" then lists and icons are completely cleared and recreated when
        cooldowns change. Default setting is "off".
        
        
    /cooling digital [button] [on/off] -- Toggle digital cooldown display.
    /cooling shadow [button] [on/off] -- Toggle clockvise cooldown shadow frame.
    /cooling alpha [button] [num] -- Set transparency 0.0 .. 1.0.
    /cooling scale [button] [num] -- Set scaling - suggested values 0.5 .. 2.0.
    
        These 4 commands will modify individual icon settings: "digital" will
        toggle number display on/off, "shadow" will toggle clockwise shadow
        on/off, "alpha" modifies transparency and "scale" modifies size of the
        icon.
        
        Alpha values means next: 0=invisible, 0.5=half transparent, 1=opaque.
        Scaling values: 0.5=half size, 1=normal size, 2=double size
        
        
    /cooling copy <character>
    
        With this command you can copy icon settings (icon group, position,
        scale, alpha) from another character you play.
        
        
    /cooling reset <layout>
    
        This command will reset icon position, groups, scale and alpha. When
        writing this doc there was 2 layouts available: 0=unsable setting, but
        visible setting, 1=icons in middle.
        
        
    /cooling rule
    
        This is command set to edit rule sets. By calling "/cooling rule" will
        output small reminder of the rule set commands. Usage of this command
        is explained later in this HOWTO.
        

Rulesets
========

    Overview (picture)
    
        abilities => rule match test => cooldown lists => sct/fct 
        items     =>                 =>                => icons

    Principle

        Fundamental principle how this add-on works is the next: When cooldowns
        change, update event of this add-on is triggered. All abilities are then
        checked against rules and if ability match the rule then it is
        attempted to add into target cooldown list. If list already contains
        cooldown with exactly the same duration (and end time) then ability is
        ignored.
        
        Rules have SOURCE, TARGET, NUM, MIN, MAX and MATCH.
        
        Cooldown lists are periodically checked and scrolling combat text
        notifications and icons are periodically formed from them to provide
        graphics and animation. Currently cooldown lists is always ordered
        so that longest is 1st and shortest is last.
        

    Rule SOURCE
    
        SOURCE is group (or type) of ability to test. Next sources are
        supported:
        
            0=general page (in spell book)
            1=1st ability page (in spell book)
            2=2nd ability page (in spell book)
            3=3rd ability page (in spell book)
            4=pet abilities (in pet spell book)
            5=equipment (items you wear)
            6=containers (items in your bags)

                
    Rule TARGET
    
        TARGET defines the cooldown list where ability should be placed if it
        matches. Next choices are available:
    
    	    0=scrolling combat text (or floating combat text)
    	    1=icon group 1
    	    2=icon group 2
    	    etc...

    	    	
    Rule NUM
    
        NUM is order of rule. Currently no real meaning except when inserting
        or deleting rules.
        
        
    Rule MIN
    
        MIN is minimum duration. To match the rule ability duration must be
        longer than MIN.
        
        
    Rule MAX
    
        Maximum duration of cooldown. To match the rule ability duration must
        be shorter or the same than MAX.
        
        
    Rule MATCH
    
        Text that ability must match. If MATCH is found in ability name then
        rule matches. If MATCH is empty then any ability will match the rule.
        
        
Rule set /slash commads and editing
-----------------------------------

    /cooling rule
    
        Small reminder how to use rules.
    
            
    /cooling rule list
    
        Lists rules
        
        
    /cooling rule reset
    
        Resets rules to default setting. Default settings vary a little
        depending on the class of the player.
        
        
    /cooling rule clear
    
        Clears the rules. Handy if you want to build your rules from the
        scratch.
        
        
    /cooling rule ins <source> <target> <num> <min> <max> <match>
    
        Insert new rule into rulesets.
        
        
    /cooling rule del <source> <target> <num>
    
        Delete rule from rulesets.
        

History, Bugs and Limitations
=============================

	In the beginning there was not a decent cooldown add-on. Some had exactly the
	display I wanted, some had too many unworkable features. Therefore Cooling
	was born.
	
	Cooling 1 is still available since it is practically perfect: 12 icons that
	simply show all abilities and items that are on cooldown in ordered list.
	User can move icons, but in general controls over what or how to see cooldowns
	was limited.

	Cooling 2 is advanced version of the classic cooling. Reason why to make such
	an addon was to allow some users to tweak cooldowns what they want to see. As
	a result this addon isn't and practically can't be perfect. There will be always
	players that are not capable to use it nor capable to even follow instructions
	how to setup it.
